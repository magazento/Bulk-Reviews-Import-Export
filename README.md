<p>This Magento extension allows you to import or export all of your customer review data in one go. It&nbsp;can import/export anything from review title, review description, and up to more advanced information,&nbsp;such as if the review has been approved or not. The reviews imported can be of any type (e.g. product,&nbsp;customer, or category reviews).</p>
<p>Importing and Exporting customer review data is somewhat difficult and unfriendly on the default&nbsp;Magento installation. Without certain development skills, the whole process can take long hours to&nbsp;complete, and you risk messing settings around. Fortunately, the Import/Export Bulk Customer Reviews&nbsp;extension resumes this process to a few simple steps only.</p>
<p>This extension will prove particularly useful for those who want to export their reviews from an older&nbsp;Magento installation and import them to a new one. All the review data can be import/export in .CSV&nbsp;or .XML format.</p>
<p>Check out the features and screenshots below for more details on how it works.</p>
